| < 1.0   | :x:                |

## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take the security of AI Orchestrator seriously. If you believe you have found a security vulnerability, please report it to us as described below.

### Please Do Not

- Open a public GitHub issue for security vulnerabilities
- Disclose the vulnerability publicly before it has been addressed

### Please Do

1. **Email us** at hoangson091104@gmail.com with:
   - Description of the vulnerability
   - Steps to reproduce
   - Potential impact
   - Suggested fix (if any)

2. **Allow us time** to respond and fix the issue before public disclosure

3. **Encrypt sensitive information** using our PGP key (available on request)

### What to Expect

- **Acknowledgment**: Within 48 hours of your report
- **Initial Assessment**: Within 7 days
- **Regular Updates**: Every 7 days until resolved
- **Fix Timeline**: Critical issues within 30 days

### Safe Harbor

We support responsible disclosure of security vulnerabilities. We will not pursue legal action against researchers who:

- Make a good faith effort to avoid privacy violations and data destruction
- Only interact with test accounts they own or with explicit permission
- Do not exploit the vulnerability beyond demonstrating it
- Report the vulnerability promptly
- Keep the vulnerability confidential until it is fixed

## Security Best Practices

### For Users

1. **Keep Software Updated**
   - Always use the latest version
   - Monitor security advisories
   - Update dependencies regularly

2. **Secure Configuration**
   - Use strong, unique credentials
   - Enable rate limiting
   - Configure proper access controls
   - Use environment variables for secrets

3. **Network Security**
   - Use HTTPS for all communications
   - Implement proper firewall rules
   - Isolate in secure network segments

4. **Monitoring**
   - Enable audit logging
   - Monitor for suspicious activity
   - Review logs regularly

### For Developers

1. **Code Security**
   - Follow secure coding practices
   - Use type hints and validation
   - Sanitize all inputs
   - Avoid hardcoded secrets

2. **Dependencies**
   - Regularly update dependencies
   - Use `safety` to check for vulnerabilities
   - Pin dependency versions

3. **Testing**
   - Include security tests
   - Test authentication and authorization
   - Test input validation
   - Use static analysis tools

4. **Code Review**
   - Require reviews for all changes
   - Security-focused reviews for sensitive code
   - Automated security scanning in CI/CD

## Known Security Considerations

### Input Validation

All user inputs are validated to prevent:
- Command injection
- Path traversal
- SQL injection (if applicable)
- XSS attacks

### Rate Limiting

Rate limiting is enforced to prevent:
- Denial of service attacks
- Brute force attempts
- Resource exhaustion

### Authentication & Authorization

- API keys should be stored securely
- Credentials should never be logged
- Use principle of least privilege

### Secrets Management

- Never commit secrets to version control
- Use environment variables or secret managers
- Rotate credentials regularly

## Security Features

### Built-in Security

- Input validation and sanitization
- Rate limiting
- Audit logging
- Secure defaults
- Least privilege execution

### Security Headers

When deploying:
- Enable HTTPS
- Set security headers
- Implement CORS properly
- Use secure cookies

## Dependency Security

We use automated tools to monitor dependencies:

- **Dependabot**: Automated dependency updates
- **Safety**: Python package vulnerability scanning
- **Bandit**: Security linting for Python

## Security Audit Log

Security-relevant events are logged:
- Authentication attempts
- Authorization failures
- Configuration changes
- Suspicious activities
- Resource access

## Compliance

This project follows:
- OWASP Top 10 guidelines
- CWE Top 25 mitigation
- Secure development lifecycle
- Regular security assessments

## Contact

- **Security Email**: hoangson091104@gmail.com
- **General Issues**: GitHub Issues
- **PGP Key**: Available on request
